### 🚀 About Me  
🔧 **Self-Driven & Passionate Coder**  
I'm a developer who thrives on solving complex problems and crafting efficient, elegant code. Every line of code I write is a step toward making systems smarter and more seamless.  

💡 **Tech Enthusiast & Lifelong Learner**  
I have a deep interest in **System Design** (both **LLD** and **HLD**), **Data Structures**, and **Core Computer Concepts**. Exploring the intricacies of how systems work and designing scalable solutions is my forte.  

🤝 **Community Contributor**  
I love collaborating on **Open-Source Projects** and sharing knowledge with the community. For me, coding is not just a skill; it's a way to connect, create, and give back.
